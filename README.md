# Step Into My City

This is a unique approach to displaying a portfolio as a showcase of my work in the UNC coding Bootcamp, as well as a few small projects I have also worked on. This project is meant to represent the level of creativity I can bring to a team or job, as well as showcase how VR can begin to play a larger roll in daily life. This project is about proving the versitility of VR, and how it has become something everyone can utilize on any device. 

## Getting Started

This project is deployed, and the only requirement for use is a browser!

### Prerequisites

1. Any current browser 
2. Maybe a VR headset, or at the very least a cardboard lense with a cellphone would be the best choice for viewing, though it can be viewed on any device with internet
